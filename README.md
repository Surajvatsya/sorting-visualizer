## Objective
Create a web application using React to visualize how various sorting
algorithms work. This project‚Äôs functionality will be similar to [this](https://sorting----visualizer.herokuapp.com/) application.

## Project Context :
We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort.
But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we
are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about
these algorithms is visualization.
That‚Äôs why we are making this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms
work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting
algorithms.

## Creating Bars 
 In this milestone, we will create bars of different heights;
which basically indicates the array that we will sort. Through these bars, we will visualize
how sorting algorithms work.

## Requirement
‚Ä¢ In the JS file just create an array and push 10 numbers.\
‚Ä¢ Create array elements using a random function, convert those numbers to an integer
number in the range 50-200 (you may take any range).\
‚Ä¢ The array integers should be the height of bars.\
‚Ä¢ Now inside the App component under the render function  where we will be placing all the bars' components.\
‚Ä¢ Now coming to the JS file we will create 10 div elements (creating elements using JS).\
‚Ä¢ Using JS add a particular className to all divs (so that we can add styles to all the div in CSS)
and all divs will have different heights equal to array elements (choose an appropriate
scale) (Changing the CSS property using JS).\
‚Ä¢ Push every bar in that particular div.\
‚Ä¢ Wrap all this in a function and make a call to that function.\
‚Ä¢ Also, add event listeners to the new array button and inside that call the function. So
that you can use that button to create a new bar every time without refreshing the
page.\
‚Ä¢ In the CSS file, you can add styles to the bars inside the class for bars.

## Implementing Bubble Sort Algorithm
Before starting this task, understand the Bubble Sort algorithm thoroughly.

Now apply the simple bubble sort algorithm. During the comparison of two elements
make the background color red for both the bars and after the comparison convert the
background color again to the default one for both the bars.

At the end of every iteration when the highest bar will be taken to the right corner then
to show that this bar is placed at its perfect position make the background color Green
in the above way.

Now when you run this you will notice that there is no delay in swapping and the other
iterations. So you have to add a delay before the swaps in order to watch how changes
are happening.

Wrap this whole thing in a function and pass this into the event listener of the bubble
sort button.

## Changing the number of bars
 This can be done mainly by attributing each bar with a relative value,
so that it becomes a pictorial representation of the array's elements that are being sorted.

## Host your website live
After completing all the milestones we have our application ready to be deployed and
hosted live onto the web.
Start off by pushing your code to your GitHub account with a good README.md to publish
your project.
Host your app live using Heroku.
